## ABOUT

Content from a self taught hobby perspective. I'm sharing coding, scripts and basically anything that I found a help to me, which in turn maybe helpful for you. I don't pretend to be an expert on coding. In fact most of what Ive learnt has come from watching other YouTube channels I subscribe to. What I can share is the coding / scripting etc which I wrote to get results shown.

I independently work on Framework2232 in my free time. If you'd like show your support, please follow and promote via the usual social networks.
