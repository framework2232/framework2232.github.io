## PURPOSE

These repositories have been constructed for two reasons: 
1. To share scripts, procedures and basically anything that I found a help to me, which inturn maybe helpful for you. 
1. To learn by _doing_, not just watching YouTube and pretending. ;)

Where possible, the contents are shared with complementing video via YouTube.
